## SORCER
Sorcer is an acronym for Service ORiented Computing EnviRonment. Sorcer is a federated computing platform centered on a global network and a seamless fusion of virtual services. 
Dynamically federated services integrate various science and engineering domains fostering transdisciplinary modeling and programming. 
Firstly, the platform allows the users to deploy everything in the global network as a virtualizable and federatable service. 
Secondly, a friendly and intuitive service-oriented programming model allows the users to dynamically compose the relevant service federations. 
These federations range from tens to thousands or even millions of services and execute in the global network with an unprecedented level of reliability.

## Getting started
Please read our [getting started guide] (getting-started.html) to learn how to install and run the Sorcer platform or go directly to our [download] (download.html) page.
Inside the Sorcer distribution you will find examples that you can easily build and run to learn more about Sorcer.
Once you get the basic services running please take a look at the Creating new Sorcer services guide to see how to start developing your own Sorcer services.
